# My Personal Job Application Tracker üìù

A simple and secure web app I built to manage my job search. It uses Flask's session management to keep every user's data completely private.

## The Story Behind This Project

While deep in my own job search, I found myself juggling dozens of applications in messy spreadsheets and endless notes. I wanted a cleaner, simpler solution to see everything in one place, so I decided to build one myself. This Job Tracker is the result‚Äîa straightforward tool designed to bring a little order to the chaos of job hunting.

Building this was also a fantastic learning experience. I got to implement a full CRUD application from scratch and dive deep into Flask's secure session management to handle user data without needing a traditional database. Taking it from a local machine to a fully deployed application on Render was a challenging but rewarding process that taught me a lot about production environments.
